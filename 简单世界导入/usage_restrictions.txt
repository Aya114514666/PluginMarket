The current world is build based on people's painful sacrifices.
Some people shielded us from disasters, but they left forever.
Therefore, we must never trample on the will we hold fast to easily.

We must remember those who sacrificed for us.
We should remember those who blocked the knife.

The past must not be ignored, and forever.
Those are all great sacrifices and they will always exist.
These things must never be forgotten or buried.

If it just passes like this, then what's the point of our struggle?
Then what was the meanings of our past fears and the concern that the community is about to die in the past?

Let's continue to remember.
FOREVER, AND FOREVER.

We sincerely remember all those who sacrificed their lives in the disaster, 
but this doesn't mean we should forget the past;

nor should they provide services, 
nor should they USE THIS PROJECT.

Any attempt to use this PROJECT in the above-mentioned organizations 
will be regarded as an insult to all the victims, such as Eternal Crystal.
